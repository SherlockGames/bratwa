- **NodeJS Server** - is an express app that handle logIn/register requests and  generate tokens for accesing **getStream Servers**. Also it make connection with Mongo DB for processing LogIns and SingUps.

- **MongoDB** - store all ids, passwords and some specific information such as mail, and name of the user

- **getStream Servers** - are servers from [getStream.io](https://getstream.io/) to save chats messages and it handle the most logic of messanging. 

- **App** - flutter app or front-end for all that stuff.
